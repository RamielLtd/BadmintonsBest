In basketball and volleyball you see a lot of the best players are tall, commonly at least six feet tall. In other sports, it's more desirable to be shorter and more compact like racing jockeys. So naturally, there must be traits that are desirable for Badminton? So do you have to be tall to play Badminton?","featured":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5086206896551724,"src":"/static/a5d9348589fd890ae1dd2c07d06c66de/ac0ae/featured.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a5d9348589fd890ae1dd2c07d06c66de/dcd85/featured.jpg 175w,\n/static/a5d9348589fd890ae1dd2c07d06c66de/be085/featured.jpg 350w,\n/static/a5d9348589fd890ae1dd2c07d06c66de/ac0ae/featured.jpg 700w,\n/static/a5d9348589fd890ae1dd2c07d06c66de/ddaee/featured.jpg 1050w,\n/static/a5d9348589fd890ae1dd2c07d06c66de/cb76e/featured.jpg 1400w,\n/static/a5d9348589fd890ae1dd2c07d06c66de/cd7d4/featured.jpg 5184w","sizes":"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"}}}}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"It's the default in Tennis and you can even see it done in squash and table tennis.

Serving overhand in other racquet sports is normally legal. A good serve can be all the difference in racquet sports.
